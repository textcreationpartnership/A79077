            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p>There was an order made by the High Court of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, that all Papiſts throughout <hi>England</hi> ſhould be diſarmed, which command the primate Officers in Cheſhire went about to obey, but the Papiſts there were ſo reſolute that they told them plainely they would not be diſarmed, which anſwer being car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryed to the Major of the City, he very wiſely, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded
<pb facs="tcp:157116:4"/> the Trayned Bands to goe ſearch, each one charging his Musket with a Bullet, and thoſe Papiſts which would not yeeld to have their houſes ſear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, preſently to ſhoot downe their houſe aboue their eares, which was to be done the next day being the 20. day of <hi>November</hi> 1641. which the Papiſts having intelligence of, gathered themſelves altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to my Lord <hi>Chomes</hi> his houſe, the chiefe Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was one Mr. <hi>Henry Starkey,</hi> and in the night time ſome of them having Armor on, the watch heard the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to make a very great noiſe without the City gates, and going, to ſee what might be the cauſe thereof, they diſcovered fifteene in Armes, battering downe the City walles, at which the watch were very much amazed, and being for the moſt part old men, to goe to reſiſt them they were fearefull, but went into the City gate againe and cryed out Treaſon, Treaſon, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the City, upon which the Citizens preſently did ariſe, the Trayned Bands preſently were in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſſe, but thirteene of the Traytors eſcaped away, but two of them were taken, who confeſſe that the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers were runne to the Lord <hi>Chomes</hi> his houſe, who were preſently purſued thither, and taken at the Lord <hi>Chomes</hi> his houſe gate, for the Porter thereof and the Guard thinking them to be ſome of the Trayne Band would not ſuffer them to enter in thither, away they were carryed to priſon, a ſtrong Guard being left at the Lord <hi>Chomes</hi> his houſe, that none of the Papiſts might iſſue out there.</p>
            <p>So ſoone as thoſe fifteene were layd faſt, the trayne Bands came to the aforeſayd Lord Chomes his houſe, &amp; comm<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters">
